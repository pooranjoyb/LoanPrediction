# Loan Prediction using ML Algorithms
Loan prediction is a crucial task in the financial industry as it helps lenders assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants and make informed decisions. In this project, we explore the application of various machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict loan repayment probabilities. By leveraging the power of ML models, we aim to improve accuracy, efficiency, and risk management in lending practices.
